## Reload device after PCI passthrough
```
Can you try the following, where ${DRIVER} is the actual device driver (check with lspci -k)?
echo '0000:82:00.0' > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/unbind
sleep 3s
echo '0000:82:00.0' > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/${DRIVER}/bind
I use it with the amdgpu driver for my GPU and it works.
